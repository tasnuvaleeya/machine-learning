% Initial matrix A and B

A = [1,2,4;5,3,2]
B = [1,3,4;1,1,1]

% Initialize constant s
s = 2

% See how element-wise addition works
add_AB = A + B

% Subtraction
sub_AB = A - B

% See how scalar multiplication works
mult_As = s * A

% matrix-scalar addition
add_As = A + s

% divide A by s
div_As = A / s
